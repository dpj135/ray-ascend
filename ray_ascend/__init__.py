    Register YR tensor transport for Ray and initialize YR backend.

    This function should be called in the driver process to initialize the YR backend
    and register tensor transport. It must also be called in each Ray actor's __init__
    to register the transport for that actor process.

    YR backend initialization uses environment variables:
        - YR_DS_INIT_MODE: "metastore" (default) or "etcd"
        - YR_DS_WORKER_PORT: DS worker port (default: 31501)
        - YR_DS_METASTORE_PORT: Metastore port (default: 2379, metastore mode)
        - YR_DS_ETCD_ADDRESS: Etcd address (required for etcd mode)
        - YR_DS_WORKER_ARGS: Additional dscli arguments

    Args:
        devices: List of device types to support. Can be:
            - ["npu"] for NPU tensors only
            - ["npu", "cpu"] for NPU and CPU tensors
            - ["cpu"] for CPU tensors only
            - None (default) for both ["npu", "cpu"]
